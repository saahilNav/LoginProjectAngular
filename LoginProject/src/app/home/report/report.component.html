<h2>Understanding the Sent Messages Report </h2>
<p>Your Sent Messages report has a few different columns and data for the dates you’ve selected. Here’s a breakdown of what shows on your report:</p>

<p>Date sent: The date and time your message was sent.</p>
<p>Reactions, comments and engagement: The number of reactions or comments the post received and its engagement rate. You can sort your sent messages by any of these metrics.</p>
<p>Comments and private messages: The filter on the right-hand side allows you to include comments or private messages in your report.</p>
<p>Pages: You can also select which specific pages you want to include in your report.</p>
<p>Totals: This gives you an overview of the total impressions, reach, reactions, comments and engagement metrics over your selected period of time.</p>
Export: You can export your report as a PDF or CSV file, as well as email it to clients or other team members. You can even schedule a delivery for the report if you want it to be sent out on a regular basis.
